        A Senior Undergraduate at IIT Kanpur, pursuing B.Tech. with Major in Electrical Engineering and Minor in Computer Science ( 
        Machine Learning and Systems). I will be graduating in July 2025 and will be joining Graviton Research Capital as a Quantitative Researcher. 
        <br>
        Throughout my college life I have explored various fields, including Electronics, IOT, Programming, Systems, Machine Learning, Probability-Statistics and Consulting. 
        Of all my exploration I have found to love ML and prob stats the most, while also enjoying occasional competitive programming. 
        <br>
        I have also have had a fair share of experience in the consulting domain having interned at BCG as a summer associate. I also served as the leader of
        IITK Consulting Group(ICG), a student lead group, using consulting and Machine Learning to create some impact in the society. Can have a better look 
        at what ICG does <u><a href="https://www.iitkconsult.org">here</a></u>.
        <br>
        Aside from all this, I love public speaking, have done it a lot during my time at ICG as well as during my intern at BCG. I also enjoy 
        reading psychology and philosophy a lot.
