    <h2><b>Brief Description</b></h2>
    The project was aimed at digitalizing handwritten nurse reports and creating Retrieval Augmentation Model(RAG), to answer patients medical queries
    over whatsapp in multiple languages.

     <h2><b>Technical Details</b></h2>
     <ol>
      <br>
     <li><u>Document OCR:</u><br>
     The nurse reports were structured and alphanumeric (English) in nature. To leverage this structured format, Google Cloudâ€™s 
    form parser was used to extract the data in table format from the handwritten sheets. This approach resulted in an accuracy of around 70%. This was further 
    improved by adding few-shot and chain of thoughts to are model resulting in  85% accuracy on poor and semi-structured images.
     <br><br>
     </li>
     <li><u>Query Retrieval Model:</u><br>
     To create a multilingual RAG model answering patient queries, we used a rich patient query response dataset in multiple language (22 languages). 
     To translate the queries we used GPT 4. The RAG model was implemented using OpenAI, and a comparative analysis was made between Vector RAG and
     Graph RAG.
