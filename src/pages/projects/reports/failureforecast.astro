      <h2><b>Brief Description</b></h2>
      The project aimed at predicting the failure in Low Cost PM2.5 sensors (LCS), up to 7 days in advance to help manage the sensor repair process better. 
      The project used Deep Time Series models to predict any upcoming failure in the LCS, by analysis of the past and current sensor readings, giving out failure probability in future.  

      <br>
      <h2><b>Technical Details</b></h2>
      The dataset contained PM2.5 time series data for 166 LCS for 1 year. Each of these sensors fails at least once during this timeline. 
      The problem was modeled as time series forecasting, predicting whether a sensor is going to fail within the next 7 days given the PM2.5 reading of the past week. 
      The implementation of the above approach was carried out using several Deep Time Series Models like Wavenet, GRU, LSTM, and Seq2Seq. 
      Below is the F1-score table showing the performance of each model across days.

      The model was generalizable to different brands of sensors and was able to successfully predict sensor failures with high confidence well in advance to better manage the resources.
